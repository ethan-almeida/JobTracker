This is a Job Tracker

Just a way for me to track what jobs I have applied to.

Tools used:-

NextJS
TypeScript
CSS
Supabase (Postgres)

This is for personal use for now.

Features to add later on:-

- URL parsing: When adding a job, I paste a link to the job in URL field and all the information auto-fills.
- Some form of job auto-update: Maybe access to my emails to auto-update if I have gotten an offer or gotten rejected. This might not be a very secure idea but hey, we go crazy in here
